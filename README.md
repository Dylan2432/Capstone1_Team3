# Electric Motorcycle Test Station


## Executive Summary

Proton Power is developing a cutting-edge battery to revolutionize electric motorcycles, addressing challenges in charging and range. Our team's project is to integrate a data acquisition system (DAQ) into a chassis dynamometer for crucial testing, ensuring accurate data collection and product validation. By selecting and integrating sensors meticulously, we aim to deliver a motorcycle test station with optimal performance while adhering to safety standards and engineering ethics.
