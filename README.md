# Electric Motorcycle Test Station


## Executive Summary

Proton Power is developing a cutting-edge battery to revolutionize electric motorcycles, addressing challenges in charging and range. Our team's project is to integrate a data acquisition system (DAQ) into a chassis dynamometer for crucial testing, ensuring accurate data collection and product validation. By selecting and integrating sensors meticulously, we aim to deliver a motorcycle test station with optimal performance while adhering to safety standards and engineering ethics.

### Stakeholders

The main stakeholder in this project is our customer Proton Power. Proton Power is a pioneering force in the realm of efficient energy, striving to overcome the global challenge of diverse charging requirements. Their cutting-edge battery technology promises faster charging and extended range, that will revolutionize the EV landscape. Proton Power is leading the design of an EV motorcycle battery with an impressive range of 400km on a single charge, offered at a fraction of the cost compared to existing models. We plan to aid them in this mission but providing data that will allow them to innovate their technology even further.

Another stakeholder in the project is Bob. Bob is a leading manufacturer specializing in electric vehicles (EVs), particularly focusing on providing affordable transportation solutions for third-world countries. With a mission to address the financial burdens associated with traditional gas-driven motorcycles, Bob has shifted its focus to producing EV bikes with lower maintenance and fuel costs. With the addition of the advanced battery from Proton along with the testing done by this team, Bob can greatly improve upon this mission.



### Recognitions

We would like to thank Jesse Roberts for continually giving feedback and advice on the project and investing plenty of time and effort into the project. We would also like to thank our mechanical engineering partnering team for providing useful insight from a unique perspective and helping the team with any mechanical problems. Next, we would like to thank past Capstone teams for their advice and support. Last but not least, we would like to thank Proton Power for giving us the opportunity to apply the knowledge learned in class to the bike they have provided us to test on.
