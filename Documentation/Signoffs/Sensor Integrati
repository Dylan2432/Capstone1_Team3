Functionality

The functionality of sensor integration within an electric motorcycle dynamometer is essential for collecting, monitoring, analyzing, and utilizing data to assess the motorcycle's performance accurately. By seamlessly integrating sensors into the dynamometer system and implementing robust data acquisition, processing, and control capabilities, users can conduct comprehensive testing and optimization of the electric motorcycle.

Constraints

No.	Constraints	Origin
3	Capture current and voltage supplied to the drive motor along with vehicle speed, torque, horsepower, and rpm and display all results. 	Design Constraint
5	Comply with all relevant codes and standards listed in II. Ethical, Professional, and Standard Considerations.	Ethics Constraint 


3: To meet this constraint, a minimum implementation of voltage, current, rpm, and torque sensors must be done. Using the measurements gathered from these sensors, speed and horsepower can be calculated through programming.


5:  To meet this constraint, the dynamometer must be designed and function in compliance with the codes and standards of NFPA, such as NEC 310.16 Conductors for General Wiring and NEC 250.122 Equipment Grounding Conductor Sizing.

Analysis

Voltage sensor:
 
This voltage transducer monitors the electrical potential difference between the motorcycle's motor controller and the electric motor. 

Current Sensor:
 
This current transducer measures the motor's power consumption, efficiency, and electrical load during dynamometer testing.

RPM Sensor:
 
This optical RPM sensor measures the motor's rotational speed, providing information on the motor's speed, and acceleration during dynamometer testing.
